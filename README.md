## Project Overview
I wanted to understand which renewable energy source is growing faster - solar or wind. Using real U.S. Energy Information Administration data from Kaggle, I analyzed generation trends from 2014-2022.

## Key Findings
- Solar energy CAGR: ~15%
- Wind energy CAGR: ~2%
- Solar is growing significantly faster, indicating an inflection point in adoption

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
- Streamlit for the interactive dashboard

## Data Source
EIA renewable energy generation data sourced from Kaggle, aggregated from monthly state-level to annual national totals.

## Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run energy_app_real.py
```
